Waterfall  Model
1 - Requirement Analysis
  -Capture all the requirements
  -Do brainstorming and wlakthrough to understand the requirements
  -Do the requirements feasability test to ensure that the requirements are testable or not
  Deliverables: RUD, Requirements Understanding Document
  
2 - System Design
  -As per the requirements, create teh design
  -Capture teh hardware/software requirements
  -Document the designs
  Deliverables: HLD, High Level Design document; LLD, Low Level Design document
  
3 - Implementation
  -As per the design, create the programs/code
  -Integrate the codes for the next phase
  -Unit testing of the code
  Deliverables: Programs Unit test cases and results
  
4 - System Testing
  -Integrate the unit tested code and test it to make sure it to make sure if it works as expected
  -Perform all the testing activities (functional and non-functional) to make sure that the system meets the requirements
  -In case of any anomaly, report it
  -Track your progress on testing through toold like traceability metrics, ALM
  -Report your testing activities
  Deliverables: Test cases, Test reports, Defect report, Updated matrices

5 - System Deployment
  -Make sure that the environment is up
  -Make sure that there are no sev 1 defects open
  -Make sure that the test exit criteria are met
  -Deploy the application in the respective environment
  -Perform a sanity check in the environment after the application is deployed to ensure the application does not break
  Deliverables: User Manual, Environment definition/specification
  
6 - System Maintenance
  -Make sure that the application is up and running in the respective environment
  -In case user encounters and defect, make sure to note and fix the issues faced
  -In case any issue is fixed; the updated code is deployed in the environment
  -The application is always enhanced to incorporate more features, update the environment with the latest features
  Deliverables: User manual, List of production tickets, list of new features implemented
